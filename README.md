Solar Panel Controller

This project aims in creating a solar panel controller (water heating panel)
steering the panel towards the sun to give optimized heating.

The panel is large and heavy so it needs some protection also not to turn too far.

Arduino implementation can be found in /Arduino while a
version created in XOD can be found in /XOD
